# Battleship Project

## Battleship - Overview

This is the final project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

This project acts as a summary to the initial introduction to TDD (Test-Driven Development) within "The Odin Project".

In particular, this project aims to implement a small battleship game (specifically, to unit test the main logic of a battleship game).

## Additional Information

As this is an initial introduction to TDD not all code has been tested.

Specifically, the code that has been tested is the following modules:

- `placementInfo.js`

- `board.js`

- `battleship.js`

- `pcPlay.js`

The above 4 modules control the main logic of the battleship game.
*The tests performed are unit tests.*
**You can find the tests [here](./src/modules/tests/).**

The rest of the modules handle the UI, DOM, etc.
*I've yet to delve into integration, E2E (End-to-End) testing, and DOM testing in general, which is the reason I've only tested the above code via unit tests.*
